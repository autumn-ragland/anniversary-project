                <p class="black-description">Our first date at Midtown wiseacre felt different than my other Tinder dates. We chatted for the week you were out of town leading up to it. You proved you are normal and probably wouldn't try to kill me. I was excited talking to you in person. I remember telling Cheyenne that you were way cuter than your pictures and really good in bed.</p>

                <p class="black-header">First Dinner at Ecco</p>
                <p class="black-description">Who could have guessed that the restaurant across the street from my old apartment would become a permanent fixture in our relationship. So permanent that I themed this whole gift around the online menu.This was officially our third date and I was already smiling at your texts. I'm almost certain we decided to go to dinner here because we had to change and make it to your friends halloween party right after so it was the easiest choice. This restaurant was the second place I went after over a year of isolating, I celebrated my two year anniversary at Ecco. It was special and out of reach. Any now we're regulars, we've tried everything on the menu, we go in jeans and sweatshirts, we have favorite servers and favorite spots! I love that Ecco feels like our place.</p>

                <p class="black-description">Meeting my friends can be a little daunting but you killed it. Cheyenne pulled me aside in the kitchen to tell me she likes you and that you fit in really well. We'd only been seeing each other for a month but we'd already hung out quite a few times and I was ready to vet you with the lesbian council. Luckily you passed with flying colors.</p>

                <p class="black-header">Officially Dating</p>
                <p class="black-description">I was beyond shocked when you asked me to be your girlfriend. Especially after you told me you wanted to keep things casual and that you were leaving memphis soon just a month prior. I also accepted that we'd only be able to date for a few months before you had to leave. And so much has changed since then. I am so glad that you finally asked me out and I'm honestly really glad that we got four months to get to know each other before taking the next step. And mostly importantly I'm glad we fell in love and you stayed.</p>

                <p class="black-header">First I Love You</p>
                <p class="black-description">I knew that I loved you the week of your birthday and I knew I was in love with you the week you went to San Francisco. Every time I said "I miss you" I really meant "I love you" and I was absolutely freaking out about telling you. I was worried it was too soon, or you didn't feel the same way, or that "I love you" didn't carry the same weight for me as it did for you. So I wimped out of telling you to your face. But now I wanna tell you that I love you as often as I say hi.</p>

                <p class="black-description">I miss you like crazy. I think about when I wake up. I think about you when something great, or horrible, or boring happens. I think about you when I'm falling asleep. You're always in my mind and in my heart. So I wanted to share this collection of thoughts about our relationship with you. It's been an amazing 6 months full of growth and love. I can't wait for you to come back home.</p>
                <p class="black-description">I love you.</p>
